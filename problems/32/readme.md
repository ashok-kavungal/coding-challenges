Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).</br>
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).</br>
Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.</br>

![Example](./question_32.jpg)</br>
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] </br>
Output: 49 </br>
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].</br>
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.</br>
